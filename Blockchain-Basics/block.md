A block is a group to collect and manage multiple transactions as one. For example, in the case of Bitcoin, about 2,000 transactions conducted for 10 minutes are bundled into one block and managed. In Litecoin, the transaction history for about 2 minutes 30 seconds is created and worked as one block. A chain structure can be made using hashes to connect one block to the next. In this way, a blockchain that bundles many transactions received from several nodes in the network then makes a chain according to time sequence.
