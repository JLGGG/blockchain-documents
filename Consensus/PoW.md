## Proof of Work

Proof of Work (PoW) is a consensus algorithm that proves that you have participated in the work by repeating the process of finding a hash nonce below the threshold countless times. PoW is done through mining.   
When a certain transaction occurs, the PoW algorithm performs a consensus method on whether the transaction is a valid transaction and verifies whether a new block is real of fake.

### Mining

Mining refers to the act of creating a block that records the transaction details of cryptocurrency and obtaining cryptocurrency in return. Mining is carried out incessantly until a result value obtained by substituting a random nonce is smaller than the suggested threshold.

### Difficulty of Work

The difficulty of work represents the degree of difficulty in calculating the nonce. The task difficulty is adjusted by a value of "bits" in the block header. Difficulty is a method that increases the difficulty when the time it takes for 2,160 blocks to be created is less than 21,600m, which is the average time, and decreases when it takes a long time. A single diffuiculty level that takes an average of 10m is applied to the whole in approximately 21,600m cycle.
