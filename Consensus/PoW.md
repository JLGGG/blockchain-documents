## Proof of Work

Proof of Work (PoW) is a consensus algorithm that proves that you have participated in the work by repeating the process of finding a hash nonce below the threshold countless times. PoW is done through mining.   
When a certain transaction occurs, the PoW algorithm performs a consensus method on whether the transaction is a valid transaction and verifies whether a new block is real of fake.

### Mining

Mining refers to the act of creating a block that records the transaction details of cryptocurrency and obtaining cryptocurrency in return. Mining is carried out incessantly until a result value obtained by substituting a random nonce is smaller than the suggested threshold.

### Difficulty of Work

The difficulty of work represents the degree of difficulty in calculating the nonce. The task difficulty is adjusted by a value of "bits" in the block header. Difficulty is a method that increases the difficulty when the time it takes for 2,160 blocks to be created is less than 21,600m, which is the average time, and decreases when it takes a long time. A single diffuiculty level that takes an average of 10m is applied to the whole in approximately 21,600m cycle.

### Reward
The reward is the sum of the newly issued bitcoin and the transaction fee of the transaction included in the block. The new issuance of bitcoin is made by adding a transaction in which a certain amount of bitcoin is deposited into the miner's wallet when the miner initially constructs a block as the generation transaction of the block. Bitcoin starts at 50BTC. After that, each time 210k blocks are added to the blockchain, they experience a half-life. Transaction fees can be set autonomously by each transaction party. The transaction fee also acts as an input value in determining the priority in which transactions are added to the block.

### Advantage
The minimum price point is clearly set, and the biggest advantage is high security. A 51% attack, which are known as blockchain vulnerabilities, can be easily prevented. A 51% attack means a maliciou sattacker must have at least 51% computational power in order to succeed in their actions(for acheiving double-spending). However, in reality, obtaining more than 51% of the proof of work is very difficult to occur because it incurs astronomical costs.

### Disadvantage
As the difficulty of mining has increased, individual miners have reached a level where they cannot mine. In addition, the need for high-end equipment required for calculation has increased, and energy wasted due to excessive power consumption. The amount of electricity consumed in bitcoin mining was estimated to be about 48 terawatt hours per year. This is similar to the annual electricity of Singapore, beyond Peru and Hong Kong per year. This structure naturally emerged by corporate miners. In addition, the problem of concentration of mining rights arises due to their unity. In the end, this form seems to blur the decentralization, which is the essence of blockchain technology.
