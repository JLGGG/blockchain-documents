## Delegated Proof of Stake 

### Overview
Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) is a consensus algorithm in which cryptocurrency owners exercise voting rights in proportion to their respective stakes to select their representatives, and make decesions by consensus among these representatives. It is similar to a representative democracy system in which parliaments are formed by electing members as representatives of the people.  

Delegated Proof of Stake is a consensus method in which nodes exercise their voting rights according to the amount of coins held to produce a kind of agent who will perform important decision-making powers. This was nicknamed "token democracy" because coin holders delegated their authority to elect representatives, similar to representative democracy. In the case of the delegated proof-of-stake method, transaction details only need to be approved by a few representative nodes, so the processing speed is much faster. Ethereum processes 20 TPS (Transaction per Second) on average, whereas EOS can process 3000 TPS, so the advantage in terms of speed has already been verified.  

However, in September 2018, a suspicion was raised that some of the representative nodes in charge of EOS block generation voted for each other to maintain the block creator status. Accordingly, it was known than there was a fatal flaw in the method of proving the mandate. As such, the delegation proof-of-stake method has a limitation in that the blockchain ecosystem can be dominated by a small number of representative nodes when the voter turnout of general nodes is low.

### Background
Because the blockchain does not have a center, a governance structure is needed for multiple users to make joint decisions. Governance is a system in which numerous participants discuss and decide with each other for a common goal. In the existing server-client structure, when a decision is made in the server, users on the client-side passively accept the decision made in the server. However, the blockchain is a decentralized P2P method. Since there is no central to making decisions, governance for all users participating in the network can reach consensus in an equal relationship and automatically implement it systematically. We need a consensus algorithm.

The first consensus algorithm introduced in the blockchain system is a proof-of-work method. PoW is an algorithm that proves you have participated in the work by repeating the process of finding a hash below the target value(threshold) countless times. This PoW is called mining because it is similar to digging many rocks with a pickaxe to dig gold in a mine. The user who first finds a hash below the target value through mining constructs the block, connects it to the chain and receives a newly issued coin in return.

## Tremendous waste of electricity
The proof-of-work method causes enormous server resources and electricity waste. Only one user won the mining competition, but many other people who participated in the competition consume huge server resources and electricity without any income. For example, if 100 nodes compete to mine one block, server resources and electricity used by the remaining 99 nodes except for successful mines are useless waste. If the competition for mining intensifies and the competition rate is 1:100,000, server resources and electricity used for 99,999 nodes are wasted. As the server resources used for mining increase, the difficulty of mining increases, and the waste of resources put by the rest of the people except for one person increases.
