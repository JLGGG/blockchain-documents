### Proof of Stake
Proof of Stake (PoS) is a consensus algorithm that gives decision-making authority in proportion to the percentage of stake held in the cryptocurrency. It is similar to having the right to make decisions in proportion to the shareholding ratio at the general shareholders' meeting. No mining process required.

### Advantage
PoS does not have a process that consumes as much enerygy as PoW. Therefore, it is more environmentally friendly than PoW. In addition, it is possible to prevent the centralization of mining by a specific mining pool.

### Disadvantage
`Unfair economic model`: This system allocates new funds in proportion to the amount of cryptocurrency holdings. That means that money can be concentrated on a small number of people. In view of this, it can be seen that the reward system is useless and provides no incentives at all.   
`Risk of loss of funds`: The PoS method requires a message verified by a system connected to the Internet in order to receive a stake. After all, stakeholders should have hot wallets that are at high risk of theft of unds by hackers. People tried to compensate for the shortcomings by granting a private key, but that is not a complete solution.

### Scalability
Like PoW, PoS has a scalability problem. The degree of performance change when there is a change in data to be processed is called scalability. Since the two consensus algorithms process transactions in units of one block, the maximum transaction value that can process per second is low. as a result, bottlenecks appear. The bottleneck is a phenomenon in which the processing system's performance decreases as the system's usage increases, and the entire system is paralyzed. PoS also does not have enough scalability to cope with bottlenecks.
